Demonstration of input signal reconstruction from the noisy output of an LTI system using AMP.
This project implements an algorithm for signal reconstruction using approximate message passing (AMP). AMP is a fast and robust iterative algorithm for solving linear inverse problems with sparse solutions. The project applies AMP to reconstruct signals from noisy and incomplete measurements.

The project is based on a homework assignment from the course “Data Science ” at North Carolina State University. The assignment requires implementing AMP in MATLAB and testing it on various synthetic signals and measurement matrices. The project also compares AMP with other methods such as least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO).

# Usage
To run the project, open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the files. Then run the following command in the MATLAB command window:

Hw9_2

This will execute the script and display the plots of the original signals, the reconstructed signals, and the mean squared error (MSE) versus iteration number for each experiment.
